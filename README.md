# EncDec
Well programmed algorithm to encrypt and decrypt information.

New encryption each time while still being able to decrypt the information correctly.
I got interested in the process of creating a good encryption so I decided to create my own algorithm that would be able to encryt the data I input inside and decrypt it while showing no evident sign of a pattern.

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/EncDec.git` and have `C++` installed and initialized. You can run the file then by runing the main class using an IDE for it.
